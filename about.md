My Name is Angel Daniel Muñoz González, I live in México, I have a son and a wife, I am in my ongoing studies of IT Engineering, but to be fair, Development has my attention rather than IT Work, My Main Focus Right now is on BackEnd Development for mobile and web applications.

I'm a simple person, I like to program stuff and I do it sometimes when work let's me :).
